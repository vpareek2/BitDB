A lightweight database written in C with a personal assistant named Ada to help with your query needs.

## Description

BitDB is a very lightweight skeleton database. Stemming from my interest in learning more about both databases and memory operations in C, I created this project by watching Computer Architecture lectures and following cstack's database tutorial. After, I used ruby for testing different database scenarios and edge cases. Then, being a native mac user myself, I used Apple ML Research's brand new MLX library to implement a Mistral-7B model finetuned with lora to be a natural language to code generator. I took heavy inspiration from the llama example from the mlx repository, and adjusted the code to use mistral. (As of Dec 16 a mistral lora example has been added to the repo.)
